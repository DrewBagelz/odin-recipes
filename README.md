# odin-recipes
Recipes project for The Odin Project's Foundations course

## Overview
A simple website featuring a homepage with links to a few recipes.
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the basics
of HTML.

## Reflections
Upon completion of the project, I realized writing a commit message
wasn't as straightforward as it seemed. I think I started off way to
vague in my subject lines, so I decided to get more specific with my
later commits. I'm sure I'll get more familiar the more I read other
developers' commit messages, and something as simple as this project 
probably isn't the place to master such a thing.
