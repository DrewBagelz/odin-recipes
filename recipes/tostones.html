        <p>Tostones are crispy, savory fried green plantains. They work well as a side to many Latin dishes, including <a href="arroz-con-gandules.html">arroz con gandules</a>.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 green plantain</li>

            <li>3 cups cold water</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>garlic powder to taste (optional)</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Peel plantain</li>
            <li>Cut plantain into 1 inch (2½ cm) slices</li>
            <li>Fill bowl with 3 cups of cold water</li>

            <li>Set the pan or skillet aside (You will be using it again shortly, so don't drain the oil)</li>
            <li>Place the plantains on a cutting board</li>
            <li>Flatten each plantain by pressing down on them with a plate or spatula (You can even use a gloved hand, if it comes to that)</li>

            <li>Reheat oil over medium heat</li>
            <li>Cook plantains for 1 minute on each side</li>
            <li>Add salt and garlic powder (optional) to taste</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, as they tend to cool off quickly</li>
        </ol>
